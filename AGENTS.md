# Agent Instructions (Repo Rules of Engagement)

This file defines how automated coding agents (and humans) should modify this repository.

The priority is **correctness and consistency of operator conventions**, not “cleverness”.

---

## 1) Non-negotiable conventions

### Pauli symbols
- Use `e/x/y/z` internally (`e` = identity)
- If you need I/X/Y/Z output for reports, convert at the boundaries only.

### Pauli-string qubit ordering
- Pauli word string is ordered:
  - **left-to-right = q_(n-1) ... q_0**
  - **qubit 0 is rightmost character**
- All statevector bit indexing must match this.

### JW mapping source of truth
Do not re-derive JW mapping ad-hoc in new files. Use:
- `fermion_plus_operator(repr_mode="JW", nq, j)`
- `fermion_minus_operator(repr_mode="JW", nq, j)`
from `pauli_polynomial_class.py`

If you need number operators, implement:
- `n_p = (I - Z_p)/2`
in a way consistent with the Pauli-string convention above.

---

## 2) Keep the operator layer clean

### Operator layer responsibilities
The following modules are “operator algebra core”:
- `pauli_letters_module.py` (Symbol Product Map + PauliLetter)
- `qubitization_module.py` (PauliTerm)
- `pauli_polynomial_class.py` (PauliPolynomial + JW ladder operators)

Agents should avoid adding algorithm logic here (VQE, QPE, optimizers, simulators).

### PauliTerm canonical source (mandatory)
Canonical `PauliTerm` source:
- `src.quantum.qubitization_module.PauliTerm`

Compatibility aliases (same class, not separate definitions):
- `src.quantum.pauli_words.PauliTerm`
- `pydephasing.quantum.pauli_words.PauliTerm`

Rules:
- Core package code **must** import `PauliTerm` from `qubitization_module.py`.
- Compatibility scripts may import `pauli_words.PauliTerm` only when required by existing interfaces; they must not introduce a new `PauliTerm` implementation.
- Base operator files **must remain unchanged**: `pauli_letters_module.py`, `pauli_words.py`, `qubitization_module.py`.
- Repo integration changes **must** be implemented with wrappers/shims around base files.

---

## 3) VQE implementation rules

### No Qiskit in the core VQE path
Qiskit is allowed only for:
- validation scripts/notebooks
- reference data generation/comparison

The production VQE path must be:
- numpy statevector backend
- minimal optimizer dependencies (SciPy optional; provide fallback if absent)

### VQE structure (required)
Implement VQE using the notation:

- Hamiltonian:
  `H = Σ_j h_j P_j`
- Energy:
  `E(θ) = Σ_j h_j ⟨ψ(θ)|P_j|ψ(θ)⟩`
- Ansatz:
  `|ψ(θ)⟩ = U_p(θ_p)…U_1(θ_1)|ψ_ref⟩`

### Ansatz selection
Default ansatz should be compatible with future time evolution:
- prefer “term-wise” or “Hamiltonian-variational” style layers
- each unitary should be representable as exp(-i θ * (PauliPolynomial))

Do not hardcode an ansatz that cannot be decomposed into Pauli exponentials.

---

## 4) Time-dynamics readiness (Suzuki–Trotter / QPE)

When implementing primitives, favor ones reusable for time evolution:
- Implement "apply exp(-i θ * PauliTerm)" and "apply exp(-i θ * PauliPolynomial)" as first-class utilities.
- Keep functions that return **term lists** (coeff, pauli_string) available for later grouping/ordering.
- Avoid architectures that require opaque circuit objects.

If adding higher-order Suzuki–Trotter later:
- do it by composition on top of the same primitive exp(PauliTerm) backend.

## 4a) Time-dependent drive implementation rules

The repo supports a **time-dependent onsite density drive** with a Gaussian-envelope sinusoidal waveform:

```
v(t) = A · sin(ω t + φ) · exp(-(t - t₀)² / (2 t̄²))
```

### Drive architecture
- The drive waveform and spatial patterns are defined in `src/quantum/drives_time_potential.py` (if present) or inline in the pipeline files.
- The compare pipeline forwards drive flags verbatim to both sub-pipelines via `_build_drive_args()` and `_build_drive_args_with_amplitude()`.
- All drive parameters are pass-through CLI flags; the compare pipeline does **not** interpret drive physics, only routes them.

### Drive reference propagator
- When drive is enabled, the **reference (exact) propagator** uses `scipy.sparse.linalg.expm_multiply` with piecewise-constant H(t) at each time step.
- The `--exact-steps-multiplier` flag controls refinement: `N_ref = multiplier × trotter_steps`.
- The `reference_method_name` in JSON output records which method was used (`expm_multiply_sparse_timedep` vs `eigendecomposition`).
- When drive is disabled, the static reference uses exact eigendecomposition — no changes.

### Spatial patterns
Three built-in patterns (`--drive-pattern`):
| Pattern | Weights s_j per site j |
|---------|------------------------|
| `staggered` | `(-1)^j` alternating sign |
| `dimer_bias` | `[+1, -1, +1, -1, ...]` (same as staggered for even L) |
| `custom` | User-supplied JSON array via `--drive-custom-s` |

### Rules for agents modifying drive code
- Do **not** add new drive parameters without also updating: (1) both pipeline `parse_args()`, (2) the compare pipeline's `_build_drive_args()` and `_build_drive_args_with_amplitude()`, (3) `PIPELINE_RUN_GUIDE.md`.
- Drive must be **opt-in** (`--enable-drive`). Default behaviour (no flag) must be bit-for-bit identical to the static case.
- All drive-related CLI args must have the `--drive-` prefix (except `--enable-drive` and `--exact-steps-multiplier`).
- The safe-test (`_safe_test_check`) must remain: A=0 drive must produce trajectories identical to the no-drive case within `_SAFE_TEST_THRESHOLD = 1e-10`.

## 4b) Drive amplitude comparison PDF

The compare pipeline supports `--with-drive-amplitude-comparison-pdf` which:
1. Runs both pipelines 3× per L: drive-disabled, A0-enabled, A1-enabled (6 sub-runs total per L).
2. Generates a multi-page physics-facing PDF per L with scoreboard tables, drive waveform, response deltas, and a combined HC/QK overlay.
3. Writes `json/amp_{tag}_metrics.json` with `safe_test`, `delta_vqe_hc_minus_qk_at_A0`, `delta_vqe_hc_minus_qk_at_A1`.

### Rules for agents modifying amplitude comparison
- All artifacts go to `json/` or `pdf/` subdirectories. Filenames use the tag convention `L{L}_{vt|static}_t{t}_U{u}_S{steps}`.
- Intermediate JSON files use the `amp_H_` / `amp_Q_` prefix: `json/amp_H_L2_static_t1.0_U4.0_S32_disabled.json`, `json/amp_Q_L2_static_t1.0_U4.0_S32_A0.json`, etc.
- Safe-test scalar metrics must always be reported on the scoreboard table. The full safe-test timeseries page is conditional (fail, near-threshold, or `--report-verbose`).
- VQE delta is defined as `ΔE = VQE_hardcoded − VQE_qiskit` (the sector-filtered energy, not full-Hilbert).
- New amplitude comparison CLI args: `--drive-amplitudes A0,A1`, `--with-drive-amplitude-comparison-pdf`, `--report-verbose`, and `--safe-test-near-threshold-factor`.

---

## 5) Style and maintainability

### Clean/simple code
- Prefer pure functions where possible (no hidden global state).
- Keep modules small, with a single responsibility.
- Use explicit types for public function signatures.
- Prefer explicit errors (`log.error(...)` or raising) over silent coercions.

### “LaTeX above Python” pairing
When adding new literate modules (like `hubbard_latex_python_pairs.py`):
- include the LaTeX expression in a string right above the function that implements it
- keep LaTeX and code aligned 1:1

### Regression/validation
Whenever you modify:
- Hubbard Hamiltonian construction
- indexing conventions
- JW mapping / number operator

You must update or re-run reference checks against:
- `hubbard_jw_*.json`

Qiskit baseline scripts may be used to sanity check, but they are not the core test oracle.

---

## 6) What an agent should NOT do
- Do not change Pauli-string ordering conventions.
- Do not introduce Qiskit into core algorithm modules.
- Do not add heavy dependencies without a strong reason.
- Do not "optimize" by rewriting algebra rules unless correctness is proven with regression tests.
- Do not add new drive parameters without updating all three pipelines' `parse_args()`, `_build_drive_args()`, `_build_drive_args_with_amplitude()`, and `PIPELINE_RUN_GUIDE.md`.
- Do not break the safe-test invariant (A=0 drive must equal no-drive to machine precision).

---

## 7) Suggested next implementation steps (for agents)
1. Replace `quantum_eigensolver.py` stub with a hardcoded VQE driver calling into a dedicated VQE module.
2. Add a VQE literate module (LaTeX+Python pairs) mirroring the Hubbard pairs pattern.
3. Add a small regression runner that:
   - builds H for L=2,3 (blocked & interleaved)
   - compares canonical Pauli dictionaries vs existing JSON references
   - runs hardcoded VQE and compares energy to exact filtered diagonalization for small sizes.
4. Extend `regression_L2_L3.sh` to also exercise the amplitude comparison mode:
   ```bash
   --enable-drive --drive-pattern dimer_bias --drive-amplitudes '0.0,0.2' \
   --with-drive-amplitude-comparison-pdf
   ```
5. Add higher-order Suzuki–Trotter (4th order) by composition on the existing primitive `exp(PauliTerm)` backend.
6. Add convergence-study scripts: sweep `--trotter-steps` and `--exact-steps-multiplier` to validate Trotter-error scaling under the drive.

--Note -- Take your time coding! Be safe, and do not rush. The user has a lot of time and does not need things quickly.

## Plans

- Make the plan consise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer/problems, if any.
